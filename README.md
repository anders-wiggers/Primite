# PRIMITE

Primite is an Android Game i created to test diffrend techneies i learned in Software Achetechture course. The App is a 'Clicker' game which features an advance Talents, Loot system, Boss system, Firebase integration and much more.

## The Game

The game is a simple clicker game. The goal is to increase in power. The player can click to deal damage to an enemy. The player can they upgrade his/her charater by advancing the Talent three or by buying new weapons. Weapons can also be optained by slaying bosses. 

### Programming Techniques

To develop the game usesing alot of differend patterns.

#### Observer

To notify the view when the player has level up I choose to use the observer pattern, by creating the `Observer.java` interface and extending it to the `PlayerImpl.java`class. The player class is the able add subscribers to an observer list which will get notified when an event has happend 

#### Strategy Pattern 

To develop the Talent point System I choose the strategy patterns as this could save me alot of work. I created the `TalentStrategy.java` interface. A standart Talent point(`Talent.java`) need a TalentStrategy to determend what is does. 

```
    @Override
    public void effect(){
        for(int i = 0 ; i<point;i++){
            talentStrategy.effect();
        }
    }
```
The talentStrategy then affect the player with a given effect for each point spend in the point. 

#### Singleton

To move infomation about the current player and load data from the database I use the singleton pattern. This pattern allow me to easily acces player data from all over the application where it is needed without passing the player directly to the object. 

The singleton `Game.java`can be accessed easly via `Game.getInstance()`So if information about the player is need it can easly be extraced via. 
```
Player player = Game.getInstance().getPlayer();
player.getLevel() 
```

This made it alot easier to program the show and weapons fragments which contains the weapons which a player can buy and the weapons a player has.
